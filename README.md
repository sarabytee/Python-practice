# 🐍 python practice playground

welcome to my python practice repo! this is a space where i test out ideas, practice syntax, experiment with APIs, solve small challenges, and occasionally break things for fun and learning.

## 📂 what's inside

this repo includes:
- practice scripts for string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and functions
- mini projects with APIs, file I/O, and error handling
- experiments with modules like `requests`, `json`, and `sqlite3`
- notes and examples from tutorials or class exercises
